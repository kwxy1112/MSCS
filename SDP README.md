# Software Development Process

This graduate-level hands-on course on software engineering teaches the way software is specified, designed, developed, verified ,and maintained. 
Java is used throughout the course and several Android apps have been made. There are six individual assignments, a group project, and a final individual project.

Individual assignments: Getting started
- 1: Team matching and survey (not a coding task)
- 2: Set up Github repo with Gitbash, IntelliJ, and Android studio  
- 3: Basic java coding
- 4: Develop a simple text encryption Android app
- 5: Design the Word Game app beginning with a UML class diagram 
- 6: Generate Junit test cases with the help of category partition 
- 7: Create white-box test cases of different structural coverage levels

Group project: Word game (Android app)
- Collaborate with a team to develop a game app on Android Studio
- Game has varying board sizes, and other settings
- Score history persists through app shutdown
- Merge individual designs into a final UML class diagram
- Create design document, project plan, test plan, use case model, and user manual
- Develop the app
- Develop the UI
- App testing and deployment
- Demo APK available: https://github.com/kwxy1112/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess/tree/main/Team/GroupProject/APK
- Design document available: https://github.com/kwxy1112/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess/blob/main/Team/GroupProject/Docs/DesignDocument.md

Individual project: Encode app
- Create a command-line utility in Java 
- App encodes input text files based on given encoding specificatoin
- Update the app for change in the encoding specification
- Test cases created at each update to ensure app functions correctly
- Find all bugs in a given app (black-box testing)
