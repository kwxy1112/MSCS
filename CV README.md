# Computer Vision

Six problem sets and a final project. All written in Python 3.8. 

Problem sets
- 1: Images as functions, exploration of image properties
- 2: Traffic light and sign detection with Hough algorithms
- 3: Augmented Reality techniques including projection and homography
- 4: Motion detection with Hierarchical Lucas-Kanade flow vectors
- 5: Object tracking and pedestrian detection with Kalman and Particle filters from scratch
- 6: Image (faces) classification with PCA, AdaBoost, and Viola-Jones

Final Project - Classification and Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
-  detect and classify street numbers of buildings using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
-  real life images subject to noise, distortion, illumation, size, etc
-  SVHN training set, Google Streetview test set
-  design the full pipeline including region proposals and the CNN
-  model training and tuning, final model selection
-  final pipeline passes five poor image conditions
