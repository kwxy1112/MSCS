# MSCS

I have made repos for the courses taken for my masters degree at Georgia Tech. They contain confidential code and are in a private repo as required by the institution but can be viewed with private access (contact me at kwxy1112@gmail.com). 

The readme for each course can be viewed the readme folder. They provide an overview of each repo.
