# Artificial Intelligence

This course is a survey of the field of Artificial Intelligence and will often be taken as the first graduate course in the area. It is designed to be challenging and involves significant independent work, readings, and assignments. The course covers most of the required textbook Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach 3rd edition, which is a keystone of Georgia Techâ€™s Intelligent Systems PhD qualifier exam.

Five assignments given. Each in its own folder which contains its own readme with instructions to recreate the work. All algorithms implemented from scratch. Numpy vectorization used wherever possible.

Assignment 1 - Graph search: Shortest Path
- Use Priority Queue with different search algorithms to find shortest path
- Biggest dataset is a real GIS map of Atlanta
- BFS, DFS, A Star, Bi-directional and Tri-directional Search

Assignment 2 - Adversarial search: Snails Isolation Game
- Defeat the opponent AI in the Isolation game (see readme for rules)
- Implement Minimax search
- Add alpha-beta pruning for deeper search
- Upgrade with iterative deepening and custom evaluation function 

Assignment 3 - Bayes Nets and probability estimation
- Create Bayes net to represent the system of conditional probabilities
- Make Bayesian inference to obtain probability of various situations
- Implement Gibbs Sampling and Metripolis-Hastings Sampling to estimate probabilities

Asisgnment 4 - Decision Trees and Forests
- Create Decision Tree using DFS
- Train with validation using k-folds
- Create Random Forest with boosting

Assignment 5 - Clustering
- Implement K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Implement Expectation Maximization Algoritm, including E-step, M-step and log-likelihood criterion
- Experiment improvements such as improved initiatlization, Bayes Information Criterion, convergence criteria
- Iterate both algorithms to convergence and compare clustering results
