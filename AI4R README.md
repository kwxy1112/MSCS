# AI for Robotics

Four projects and a number of problem sets located in the individual folders. The instruction PDFs in each folder provide the best picture. All code written with Python 3.

Asteroids Project
- Use Kalman Filter to observe, profile, and predict asteroid movement
- Navigate the spacecraft through the asteroid field

Gem Finder Project
- Utilize Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on landmarks
- Navigate the robot to collect gems using A* path search

Mars Glider Project
- Use particle filter to localize glider location based on measured terrain data
- Navigate to a designated location

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Mini Projects
- Control sensitive components of a liquid rocket engine
- Control rocket output to maintain two specific profiles for launch and reentry
- Control rocket fuel mixing for specific rocket output
