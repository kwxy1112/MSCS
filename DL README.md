# Deep Learning

Four assignments and a final project is located in the individual folders. The writeup PDFs provide the best picture. Final project written in CVPR Latex format.

Final Project - Food Image to Recipe
- Create the full pipeline (see Figure 1 in writeup PDF)
- Uses dual CNN models (optical and categorical) to enhance prediction accuracy
- Scrape and clean data
- Reduce data with PCA and NMF
- Score correlation with Kendall-Tau
- Model design, training, tuning of architecture variants
- Reduce computational load
- Full implementation detail in Appendix A (see writeup PDF)
